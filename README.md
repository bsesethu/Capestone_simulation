# ðŸ“Š African Crime Statistics Capstone Simulation

## Overview
This simulation project challenges students to explore, analyze, and visualize crime rate statistics across African countries. The objective is to apply research, data engineering, and analytical skills to extract insights, identify patterns, and propose data-informed solutions or narratives related to crime in Africa.

## Objectives
- Conduct thorough research on crime statistics across African nations.
- Identify and validate reliable data sources.
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize crime trends across geography and time.
- Provide contextual insights, supported by socio-economic and political factors.

## Key Research Questions
- What are the crime rate trends across African countries over the past decade?
- How do socio-economic indicators (e.g., GDP, unemployment, education) correlate with crime?
- Which countries or regions show significant increases or decreases in specific crime types (e.g., theft, homicide, corruption)?
- How reliable and available is crime data across the continent?

## Deliverables
- **Research Report (PDF)** â€“ Summary of findings, supported by visualizations.
- **Data Pipeline (Code)** â€“ Scripts for ingestion, transformation, and EDA (preferably in Python, SQL, or R).
- **Dashboard (Optional)** â€“ Interactive data visualization dashboard using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Dash.
- **GitHub Repo** â€“ Well-structured repository containing:
  - `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets
  - `notebooks/`: Analysis and visualizations
  - `src/`: Scripts for ETL
  - `README.md`: Project documentation
  - `report/`: Final capstone report

## Suggested Tools & Libraries
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `geopandas`
- SQL (PostgreSQL or SQLite for local exploration)
- Power BI / Tableau / Dash / Streamlit for visualization

## Evaluation Criteria
